                    <p>Our story starts with a charming captain. Captain Edward “Navi” Storms had sailed the seas for 47 years on his ship, the North Star. Even though his job was to navigate the 758-foot vessel, Captain Navi couldn’t help to entertain. If he weren’t at the ship's helm steering the boat, you would find him in Club List spinning tracks for his slew of onboard guests. When he retired from a captain’s duty, he wanted to keep the spirit of North Star alive, and thus <span class="font-brand">navbar</span> was born.</p>

                    <p>Captain Navi took the remnants of the ship to build up the bar. The bar is also decorated with portraits of the captain, his old crew, famous passengers who boarded the North Star, and photos of events. The decor is heavily inspired by the original design of the ship’s interior, from dark oak paneling to vibrant colored seating. If you’re lucky enough, you may catch Captain Navi at the DJ booth entertaining his guests. You can never go wrong with a night at the <span class="font-brand">navbar</span>.</p>
